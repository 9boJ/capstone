        <h2 >I have Overcome challenges such as moving schools and struggling to make new friends while adapting to a new environment has 
          been a significant journey for me. Initially focused on popularity and external validation, I've since matured, prioritizing 
          self-importance and nurturing meaningful friendships. One of my proudest accomplishments involves orchestrating a successful 
          camping trip with friends, fostering lasting bonds and cherished memories. Looking ahead, I'm committed to pursuing a career in 
          technology, supported by a blend of academic pursuits, part-time work, and family backing. This vision extends into the future, 
          where I aim to continue balancing professional growth with family responsibilities, eventually securing a fulfilling role in the 
          tech industry or contributing to my family's business endeavors.</h2>
